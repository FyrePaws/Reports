    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals with Subtle Accents -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as a narrative journey to prove the user's thesis of Mastercard's "quiet conquest." It starts with a bold thesis statement, moves to an interactive timeline to show the progression from "covert" R&D to overt market action, then breaks down the current strategy into four distinct "pillars of conquest" (Infrastructure, Partnerships, CBDCs, R&D). A competitive view against Visa provides context, and a concluding analysis reinforces the main thesis. This thematic, story-driven structure was chosen over a simple report layout to make the complex information more engaging and to guide the user through the evidence supporting the core argument. Key interactions include timeline event pop-ups, clickable diagrams, and dynamic charts to let users explore the depth of the strategy. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Thesis Intro (Inform): A strong textual summary sets the stage. Interaction: None. Justification: Clearly states the report's purpose.
        - Interactive Timeline (Change): An HTML/CSS timeline shows the evolution of Mastercard's strategy. Interaction: Click events on points to reveal details in a modal. Justification: Visually demonstrates the shift from a "quiet" phase of patenting and research to an "acceleration" phase of public partnerships and product launches, which is central to the user's thesis. Method: Custom JS and Tailwind CSS.
        - Strategy Pillars (Organize/Inform): A 4-column grid presents the core strategy. This includes an HTML/CSS diagram for infrastructure, a bar chart for partnership growth, an interactive "map" for CBDC involvement, and a bar chart for patent filings. Interaction: Hover/click on diagram elements, dynamic chart rendering. Justification: Breaks down a complex strategy into digestible, thematic chunks. The visualizations were chosen to quantify and illustrate the scale and long-term nature of their efforts. Library: Chart.js for charts.
        - Competitive Analysis (Compare): A simple HTML table compares Mastercard and Visa. Interaction: None. Justification: Provides necessary market context for Mastercard's strategic moves. Method: HTML/Tailwind CSS.
        - Conclusion (Inform): A final text block synthesizes the findings. Interaction: None. Justification: Summarizes the key takeaways and reinforces the initial thesis.

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 max-w-3xl mx-auto">Mastercard's journey into the digital asset space is a masterclass in corporate strategy. What appeared to be a slow, cautious adoption was, in fact, a deliberate and covert period of building a deep technological and intellectual property moat. Through strategic infrastructure development, extensive partnerships, and proactive engagement with central banks, Mastercard has successfully transitioned from a legacy payment processor to a potential architect of the future financial system. They are not just adapting to a new market; they have actively and quietly built the infrastructure to control it.</p>
